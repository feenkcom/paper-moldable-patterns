Hi Petr,

Thanks for your kind comments!

It's great that the idea is clear already in section 2! The goal of the paper is to explain moldable development through the patterns, so I'm happy if the idea is emerging already on page 2, but I'll see if I can add something

Actually GT is open source and downloadable for Linux, Mac and Windows. It includes live notebook pages of all the patterns, as well as the full Ludo game. There are also numerous YouTube videos demoing moldable development and aspects of GT. I can highlight this earlier in the paper.

In my first email I wrote this: 

“A key concern is the audience. There are three main readers we would like to target:
(1) a general audience of technically knowledge readers who are curious about what we do (evangelizing),
(2) current users and newcomers to GT, our platform, who would like to understand better how to use our platform (onboarding), and
(3) developers and stakeholders committed to other platforms, who are interested in making moldable development work for their technology (more evangelizing, and technology transfer).”
I can try to summarize this briefly in the abstract.

Not sure what you mean. The pattern headings are already in bold and on their own lines. Would it help to start each one with “Pattern:” eg “Pattern: Moldable Tool”?

OK.

Hm. I would rather let the workshop group tell me which patterns need more work. Or perhaps you can tell me which patterns you found hard to understand or did not seem to fit?

To sum up, then, here are the things I'll try to address in the next version:
- Add some more explanation of MD in the Intro.
- Explain that the system is downloadable, including demos and the patterns.
- Summarize in the abstract who is the audience and what they should get out of it.
- Label the patterns “Pattern: ...”
- Prepare a single-column conference version of the paper with double spacing and line numbers.
